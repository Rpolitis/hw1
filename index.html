navigation bar and has two paragraphs of content about myself and the classes I'm taking.

		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p> My name is Ryan Politis. I'm 20 years old and a junior undergraduate computer science major currently 
			attending the University of Massachusetts Lowell. Ever since I was young, I've 
			been fascinated with computers. My first encounter with a computer was with an old 
			desktop in pre-school. The only game on it was SkiFree and I remember taking turns 
			with the other kids and trying to see how far down the mountain each of us could go. 
			Another memorable experience I had with a computer was playing games such as Wizard 101, 
			Club Penguin, and Roblox on my Dad's old desktop. These early interactions with 
			computers inspired me to take an interest in how they work and influenced me to 
			get a degree in computer science.
		<p>
		<h1>Classes & Coursework</h1>
		<p> Currently, I'm taking 5 classes and 1 lab. The classes I'm taking for my first semester 
			of junior year are Foundations of Computer Science, Computer Architecture, Discrete 
			Structures 2, Exploring the Universe, and Graphical User Interface Programming 1. The lab 
			I'm taking is for Exploring the Universe. Thus, this semester, I am taking 16 credits worth 
			of classes. <br> <br>

			In the future, I plan on taking Graphical User Interface Programming 2 and using the class 
			sequence to fulfill my project requirement to graduate. I do find myself enjoying the process 
			of making a website and designing how it looks. Although, it was tough at first since I have 
			never used HTML or CSS to make a webpage before.
