GUI Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page
What the file does: This is the webpage under the "Bass" button on the navigation bar. This webpage 
has a paragraph explaining my history starting out playing the bass guitar. It also has a table 
that shows some of the songs I've practiced and attempted to play/memorize.

		<h1>Bass Guitar</h1>
		<p>Since senior year of high school, I've been learning and practing the bass 
			guitar. I've always enjoyed listening to music and learning how to play 
			songs has made me truly appreciate the amount of effort it takes to 
			write a piece of music. Originally, I had learned to play the flute 
			during middle school, however I didn't find enjoyment in playing it. 
			I had thought intially that learning how to play an instrument wasn't 
			for me. That was until I picked up the bass. Something about the heavy 
			strings and the deep tone of the instrument spoke to me and I was hooked. 
			I practice nearly everyday and have even started playing with my friends 
			in our makeshift band. My friends and I are planning on making our own music in the 
			future, although we don't expect to be professional musicians. As of now, I 
			firmly believe that anyone can pick up an instrument and learn to play. All 
			it takes to learn how to play an instrument is passion and a willingness to learn.
